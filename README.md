## Inspiration  
Living in an urban environment like Boston, we recognize trees' crucial role in improving air quality, reducing carbon emissions, and mitigating rising temperatures. We created Green Gauge to raise awareness and provide actionable insights to policymakers and the community, helping enhance Bostonâ€™s environmental quality.

## What It Does    
Green Gauge allows users to input an address anywhere in the world. It retrieves a satellite image of the location, processes it using a pre-trained CNN model (which can be found [here](https://deepforest.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.0/)), and generates an analysis. The results are then sent to the Open AI Vision LLM, which provides actionable insights. The tool evaluates tree coverage percentage, number of trees, weather conditions, and air quality, offering valuable data to drive environmental improvements.

## How We Built It  
We developed Green Gauge using React + Vite for the front end. We integrated several APIs, including OpenAI Vision, AirVisual API, and Mapbox to gather and analyze environmental data. These APIs enable us to retrieve satellite images and extract relevant ecological insights.

### My contributions:  
Given our limited time and resources, I primarily focused on finding the best way to process and analyze the satellite image using the best pre-trained model. After hours of searching, I integrated Deepforest and found additional information from AirVisual. My contributions can mostly be found in the scripts section of the repo.

### Challenges We Faced
One of our biggest challenges was effectively analyzing satellite images. We struggled to find a pre-trained model that provided sufficiently accurate results. Given time constraints, training a CNN model from scratch was infeasible, so we relied on an existing vision model capable of detecting trees rather than multiple land-use classes like roads or rooftops.

### Accomplishments We're Proud Of
We are proud of the accurate environmental assessments generated by our pre-trained CNN model and the insightful recommendations provided by OpenAI Vision. Despite challenges, our tool successfully extracts and interprets key ecological data.

### What We Learned
We gained experience using Mapbox-GL's API and converting its images into a format compatible with DeepForest and OpenAI Vision. This knowledge expanded our ability to work with geospatial and AI-driven environmental analysis tools.

### Deployment
Unfortunately, deploying Green Gauge using the OpenAI API is too expensive for us to maintain; however, a demo video of the system can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rFr6zJA81k&ab_channel=FrankSeely):
